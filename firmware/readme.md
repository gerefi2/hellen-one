[Q&A on source code](https://gerefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=10)

This directory contains the source code for the gerefi embedded firmware.

TL;DR

``make``

# Environment

Embedded firmware is build on top of https://www.chibios.org/ with plain Makefile gcc version 12 (See https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/blob/master/.github/workflows/hardware-ci.yaml to confirm current GCC version)

Windows development is fully supported with Cygwin, WSL or Linux is recommended due to poor NTFS performance.
