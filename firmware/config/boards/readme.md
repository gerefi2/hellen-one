# Boards Directory

TL,DR: for community edition see f407-discovery.

gerefi supports quite a wide array of hardware:
 * most supported platforms are stm32f4 and stm32f7
 * alpha version support stm32h7
 * experimental support [kinetis](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/general-purpose-mcus/k-series-cortex-m4:KINETIS_K_SERIES)
 * experimental support cypress MCUs.

Looking for most default firmware for your own hardware? See f407-discovery

We support on-board a number of smart GPIO chips, overall we support quite a wide array of hardware. With all those options our goal is to provide nice _user_ experience which means upfront investment by _board designer_.

For best user experience we have more than a dozen of different _binaries_ which are all compiled from same _firmware_ files with different configuration. This folder is all about that process.

See https://gerefi.com/build_server/

By definition, BOARD_NAME is a folder in firmware\config\boards

One BOARD_NAME could be producing a number of artifacts via compile_$BUNDLE_NAME.sh scripts

Work in progress: SHORT_BOARD_NAME becomes BUNDLE_NAME

New board procedure once you have new folder in this *boards* directory

1) update [gen_config.sh](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/blob/master/firmware/gen_config.sh): add "board board" pair into 'for BOARD' iteration - this would produce new signature*.h file and new gerefi*.ini file

2) update [build-firmware.yaml](https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-firmware.yaml) to get new firmware bundle on https://gerefi.com/build_server/

3) add connector pinout mapping [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file see examples of yaml files in 'connectors' subfolders here.

## FAQ

# Q: how do I change Primary UART pins via TS?

A: Primary UART, critical error LED pin and maybe a couple more of the most fundamental pins could NOT be changed via TS. You would need another binary altogether - either another official binary or a custom binary.

# Q: I need more info!

A: please remember about https://github.com/gerefi/gerefi/wiki/Hardware#q-this-is-all-very-cool-but-you-guys-do-not-have-a-plugplay-for-my-trabant-i-think-i-will-go-and-make-a-new-gerefi-board-just-for-my-trabant

# Q: I insist on custom
