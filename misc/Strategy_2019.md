[Update: this is still gerefi strategy even for 2020]

1a) As of June 2019, gerefi has a _LOT_ of potential but probably is pretty far from being easily usable and pretty far from being
easy to use.   

1c) As of June 2019, only 4 to 6 vehicles TOTAL have put any significant miles on gerefi. _Significant_ means 10 000 km per vehicle.

1e) Most of the 51 vehicles with gerefi have driven below 10 km per vehicle.

1g) gerefi has a number of great hardware options and **reliable** firmware. While **reliable**, the models and features of
the software are extremely limited.  

1i) As of 2019, gerefi focus is on tools, infrastructure and development community.

1m) In order to get more developers to contribute to gerefi firmware and content, gerefi Strategy 2017 and
Strategy 2018 was to provide kits and assembled units of highly flexible but large and not very cheap [Frankenso](https://gerefi.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hardware:For_Sale) board.

1s) gerefi Strategy 2019 (Update: and 2020) is to provide the community with smaller and cheaper boards. Maybe [microgerefi](https://github.com/960/hw_microgerefi) maybe 
[Deucalion](https://gerefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1516).

1z) it is NOT gerefi Strategy 2019 to market gerefi to a wide retail audience. The lack of documentation and the steep
learning curve would cause a less than ideal user experience.
